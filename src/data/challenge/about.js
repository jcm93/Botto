        name: "Random Challenge", emoji: "🎲", desc: "A random challenge is a randomly generated configuration of track, racer, and other conditions for you to race. For challenges that don't specify conditions, it is implied that you race forwards with upgrades, for 3-laps, using no skips. Specified conditions may include no upgrades, mirror mode, skips, backwards, and alternate lap counts. The odds of rolling a challenge that has one of these special conditions can be adjusted in your ⚙️ Settings. Private challenges must be completed in 15 minutes to earn full winnings. After 15 minutes, a private challenge is marked 💨 Abandoned and can be completed by anyone for half the original winnings."

Submit your time in the same format as it appears in the results screen and you may add a small note as well. Truguts are awarded depending on how fast your submitted time is compared to the given goal times and how your winnings are set up. In addition to the goal time winnings, bonuses are available for beating other players' best times, beating your own time, rating challenges, daily streaks, and completing non-standard or long challenges ."

There are 3 tiers of hints, ranging from giving a 1-part hint to a 3-part hint. The hints often apply to more than one track or racer, but if you're feeling lucky there's a chance that a 1-part hint is specific enough to guide you to the right challenge."

Sponsorship fees vary by circuit.\n• When a challenge is rolled for the sponsorship, it will use your current odds so you might want to adjust your odds depending on what kind of challenge you want to sponsor.\n• Sponsoring a challenge attaches the sponsor's name to that specific challenge forever and nets the sponsor 20% on every trugut earned through that challenge, including predictions. Rerolling a sponsored challenge is always free to its sponsors and any reroll costs will be pocketed by its sponsors. \n• When sponsoring a challenge, you will have the opportunity to give it a custom name and set a sponsor time  that will grant a large bonus if beaten by a player.  These are optional.\n• Sponsoring a challenge starts an open challenge. This open challenge lasts 24 hours and can be completed once by anyone.\n• A user can only sponsor one challenge per day. Sponsorships stack (in the rare chance of rolling the same sponsorship)."
