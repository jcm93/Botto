## Current Features

## Updates  
Week of 03Mar19:
* Lookup commands now use space instead of colon (!racer ab instead of !racer:ab)
* !help changed to ?help
* !chancecube command added - returns blue or red 50/50
* !track <circuit> limits randomizer to specific circuit
* !track <planet name> limits randomizer to specific planet
* !racer canon - limit random racer by canon racers
* Misc
  * “Adlar Beedo” corrected to “Aldar Beedo”
  * !racer sandwich now looks up Wan Sandich (Sandwich)
## Work-in-Progress
* !racer tier - limit random racer by tier
* selfassign roles like !multiplayer

## Ideas
* If someone reacts to a track with a certain emote, botto responds with that track's shortcuts in gif form
* !track index
* !racer index
* !racers - assign each player in voice chat random racer [canon and tier as well]
* !teams # have bot split number of players in the voice channel into n number of teams
* Calculate track length to include as stat
* Have bot announce when weekly races are about to start
* Add keyboard shortcuts
